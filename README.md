# DuckDuckGo !bang searches for Safari 6+

Enables [DuckDuckGo !bang searches](https://duckduckgo.com/bang) in Safari's location bar.

If the query starts with a bang (!) Safari will redirect the search via DuckDuckGo.
Otherwise, Safari's current search engine will be used as normal.

This is an effective solution for the lack of a Chrome-style OmniBar in Safari.
