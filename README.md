# Safari !Search Extension

This extension enables [!bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang) in Safari's
address bar.  You can use a !bang to search on a specific site.  For
example, to search for "coffee" on Wikipedia you would type `!w coffee` in the
address bar and press enter. To search for "shoes" on Amazon you would use `!a
shoes`, and so forth.

Download `bangsearch.safariextz` from the
[releases page](https://github.com/tbastos/safari-bangsearch/releases)
and double-click on it to install.

## How it works

Bangs are powered by [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com). See the [list of
available !bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang) on their website.

This extension redirects every search that starts with a `!` to DuckDuckGo.
For other searches, Safari's default search engine is used as normal.

**Tip:** to quickly perform a search in the current tab, press Command-L and
start typing.

## Why?

Safari's lack of search _shortcuts_ in the address bar used to impair my
productivity. While Chrome supports _search keywords_ in the Omnibox and
Firefox has the Omnibar extension, Safari has a feature called "Quick Website
Search" which, unfortunately, is too cumbersome to use, as it requires you to
type a website's full domain name before you can search it.

DuckDuckGo bangs allow me to search much faster. I could set Safari to always
use DuckDuckGo, but the truth is I still prefer Google for general searches.
This extension allows me to use Google by default and switch to DuckDuckGo for
site-specific searches.
